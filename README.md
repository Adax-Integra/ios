## Branch, Commit, and PR Conventions

**Important Note:** Everything must be written in English.

### Branch Conventions

Branch names must follow a specific structure, and the `<description>` part must be written in **camelCase**.

**Standard Format (with User Story):**
`label/{us-code}-<description>`

The primary labels to use are `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, and `chore`.

**Examples:**

- `feat/r-01-login`

- `fix/v-07-submitCase`

- `refactor/g-02-registerExternal`

**Format (without User Story):**
If the branch does not belong to a specific user story, omit the `{us-code}` and just use the label and description.

`label/<description>`

**Example:**

- `docs/readme`

### Pull Request and Commit Conventions

Pull Requests titles and Commit messages share the same format. They must follow **conventional commits**, always in lowercase.

**Format:**
`label({us-code}): <description>`
_(Note: As with branches, omit the `({us-code})` scope if the commit is not tied to a specific user story)._

**Examples:**

- `feat(v-02): add info visualization`

- `docs(r-01): add openapi docs`

- `docs: update project readme`

### Conventional Comments

When reviewing Pull Requests, please use [Conventional Comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/) to make feedback clear and actionable for your peers.

**Format:**
`<label> [subject]: <comment>`

**Common Labels:**

- `issue:` - A problem that needs fixing.
- `suggestion:` - A proposed change (often paired with a code snippet).
- `question:` - Asking for clarification or context.
- `nitpick:` - A minor, trivial detail (e.g., a typo or formatting issue).
- `praise:` - Positive feedback on a job well done.

**Examples:**

- `issue(blocking): This logic will fail if the user array is empty.`
- `suggestion(non-blocking): We could extract this into a helper function to avoid repetition.`
- `question(blocking): What happens if the API call times out here?`
- `nitpick(non-blockin g): Typo in the variable name.`
